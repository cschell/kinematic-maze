## Navigating the Kinematic Maze: A Comprehensive Guide to XR Motion Dataset Standard

Welcome to the official repository for the accompanying webpage of our [research paper](http://downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/2024-01-Rack-Navigating_the_Kinematic_Maze.pdf). This repository serves
as a central hub for various resources and tools related to our paper:

1. **Motion Visualization Tool**
2. **XR Motion Dataset Conversion Tool** 
3. **XR Motion Dataset Catalogue**

### 1. Motion Visualization Tool

Included in this repository is our **Motion Visualization Tool**, which is a key component of our research. As of now,
it resides within this repository, but we plan to migrate it to its own dedicated repository in the near future.

For researchers looking to experiment with XR (Extended Reality) motion replays, we have something special for you.
Within this repository, you will find the `reusable_motion_player` folder. This tool allows you to play your own XR
motion replays, providing a hands-on experience with our technology. We encourage you to try it out and explore its
capabilities.

Navigate to the "reusable_motion_player" folder to find the tool. Instructions for usage are included within the folder.

### 2. XR Motion Dataset Conversion Tool

The **[XR Motion Dataset Conversion Tool](https://github.com/cschell/xr-motion-dataset-conversion-scripts)** is an
essential
tool we have featured in our work. For each dataset mentioned in our paper, this tool provides a dedicated script,
designed to convert these datasets into the format and specifications outlined in our research. After converting one of 
the datasets, it may be visualized with the help of our **Motion Visualization Tool**.

For the lazy among us, we have already done this work ourselves, introducing the:

### 3. XR Motion Dataset Catalogue
We are also excited to introduce the
**[XR Motion Dataset Catalogue](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cschell/xr-motion-dataset-catalogue)**.
This catalogue is a comprehensive collection of some of the most significant XR motion datasets available. What makes
this catalogue unique is its detailed overview of the units and standards used across these datasets. Additionally, it
includes options to download these datasets in their respective standards directly from Huggingface.

We believe this catalogue will be an invaluable resource for researchers and enthusiasts in the field of XR motion
analysis.

### Contributing

Your contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions, corrections, or contributions to the code or the catalogue,
please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on this repository. We appreciate your input in improving our
tools and resources.

### Support and Contact

If you encounter any problems or have questions regarding the Motion Visualization Tool or the XR Motion Dataset
Catalogue, please do not hesitate to contact us. You can raise an issue on this repository or reach out to us via
